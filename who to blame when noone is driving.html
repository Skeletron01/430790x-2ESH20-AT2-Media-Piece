    <h1>Who's to blame when no one is driving?</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Ben Butler · 24 July 2025</div>

    <p>For over a century, responsibility on the road has been straightforward: if there's an accident, the driver is at fault. But as self-driving cars become more common, this simple idea starts to break down. What happens when there isn't really a driver at all?</p>

    <p>Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system highlights this dilemma. The version available in most places today is supervised, meaning the human driver must keep their hands on the wheel and be ready to intervene at any time. If there's a crash, the law still points to the person in the driver's seat, even if the car was technically the one making the mistake.</p>

    <p>Unsupervised FSD, however, is where things get complicated. In a world where cars drive themselves entirely, blaming the "driver" stops making sense. Should responsibility fall on the car's owner for choosing to activate the system, the manufacturer for building it, or the engineers who designed the algorithms? Insurance companies are already scrambling to answer these questions, with some exploring policies that treat the car itself more like a product than a driver.</p>

    <p>Right now, the law hasn't caught up. Accidents involving autonomous vehicles sit in a legal grey zone. Until governments and regulators step in, self-driving cars will keep raising the same uncomfortable question: who's at fault when no one is really driving?</p>
