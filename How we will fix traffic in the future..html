    <h1>How we will fix traffic in the future</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Ben Butler · 24 July 2025</div>

    <p>Traffic jams have been an issue ever since cars became mainstream. You've probably experienced one at least once in your life. Currently, cities add more lanes, increase speed limits and build bypasses or elaborate intersections but this is costly and isn't always possible due to space constraints.</p>

    <p>One of the most common ways to manage traffic at city intersections is through the use of traffic lights. This works well enough in most situations but can be an issue during peak hours due to the long wait times needed between each cycle to ensure that the intersection is clear.</p>

    <p>This issue could be solved relatively  easily through the widespread adoption of self-driving cars. Since traffic lights are just a tool used for drivers to communicate between each other there is no reason this couldn't be substituted out for another form of communication. Computers can communicate between each other at the speed of light, allowing for traffic lights to be removed and instead have the cars keep track of who is in the intersection at any time. An example of how this may work is shown below in an animation created by CGP Grey.</p>
