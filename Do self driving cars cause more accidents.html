    <h1>Do self driving cars cause more accidents?</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Ben Butler · 3 August 2025</div>

    <p>Self-driving cars are no longer a futuristic dream — they're quickly becoming a reality on Australian roads. From small trials in suburban streets to major investments by automotive giants, autonomous vehicle technology is picking up speed.</p>

    <p>But what does this shift mean for the average Aussie? How will it impact jobs, urban design, and road safety? These are the questions that governments, businesses, and citizens must start answering — and quickly.</p>

    <p>Transport experts say Australia is uniquely positioned to adopt this technology, thanks to its vast road networks, adaptable infrastructure, and public interest in tech-forward solutions. However, challenges remain, including regulation, ethical concerns, and the readiness of regional areas.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the road to automation will be a gradual one, but it's clear that the journey has already begun. The next few years will be critical in shaping how — and how well — autonomous driving fits into Australian life.</p>
