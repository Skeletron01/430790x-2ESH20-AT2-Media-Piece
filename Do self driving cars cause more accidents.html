    <h1>Do self driving cars cause more accidents?</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Ben Butler · 3 August 2025</div>

    <p>You may have seen on the news recently several accidents involving Tesla's, Waymo's and other self-driving cars. This may give many people the impression that self-driving cars can cause more accidents than human drivers do and this is just not true. In 2022 1,185 people died in road related incidents in Australia.</p>
    
    <p>Whilst Australia is still yet to legalise full self-driving cars, we can use some statistics from the United States. According to warpnews.org, there are 50.5 crashes per million miles driven (CPMM) when humans are behind the wheel whereas knrlegal.com reports only 9.1 CPMM in driverless cars.</p>

    <p>Many news outlets use statistics that re-inforce their point that self-driving technology is unsafe. For example, in an article posted by consumershield.com titled "Self Driving Car Accidents Trend Chart (2025)", they included the following graph</p>

    <p>From first impressions, it seems as if the number of self-driving cars involved in accidents is rapidly increasing which is true, but not for the reasons you may think. The main reason the number of accidents in self-driving cars is increasing is because the number of self-driving cars on the road is increasing. This is like saying that 2025 is the most dangerous time to live because more people die each year than in the 1650's.</p>
