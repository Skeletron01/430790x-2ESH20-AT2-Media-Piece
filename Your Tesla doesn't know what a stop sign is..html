    <p>That's right, a Tesla doesn't actually know what a stop sign is anymore. The self driving cars have gone through various different redesigns of both the hardware and software, with Elon not being afraid to scrap everything and start again, which is what he did with the jump from version 11 to version 12.</p>

    <p>Prior to version 12, Tesla's software engineers painstakingly programmed in what to do in every senario that their cars may come across. They wrote code to identifty a specific pattern of red pixels in an octagonal shape and then code to steadily apply the brake which would result in the car coming to a complete stop.</p>

    <p>Whilst this worked for most situations, with the almost infinite possible different ways that a car could apprioach a stop sign, and then accounting for the varying lighting conditions, damage that may be on the signs or obstructions this code got very large and almost imposible to maintain.</p>

    <p>Because of this, Elon decided to scrap all the code and instead start using a neral network to power their self-driving technology. A neral network is a </p>
