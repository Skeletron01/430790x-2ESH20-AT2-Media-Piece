    <h1>Your Tesla doesn't know what a stop sign is.</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Ben Butler · 29 July 2025</div>

    <p>That's right, a Tesla doesn't actually know what a stop sign is anymore. The self-driving cars have gone through various overhauls, with CEO Elon Musk not being afraid to scrap everything and start over, which is what he did with the jump from version 11 to version 12.</p>

    <p>Prior to version 12, Tesla's software engineers painstakingly programmed what to do in every scenario that their cars may encounter. They wrote code to detect a specific pattern of red pixels in an octagonal shape, followed by instructions to gradually apply the brake, bringing the car to a complete stop.</p>

    <p>Whilst this worked for most situations, with the almost infinite possible ways that a car could approach a stop sign, along with varying lighting conditions, damage on the signs or obstructions, this code got very large and almost impossible to maintain.</p>

    <p>In response, Elon decided to scrap all the code and instead use a neural network to power their self-driving technology. A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence that learns by example, mimicking how the human brain works by recognizing patterns and making decisions based on vast amounts of training data.</p>

    <p>This in turn means that not even Tesla's engineers know exactly how their self-driving technology works, and that's the point. Your Tesla doesn't actually <b>know</b> what a stop sign is. It's no longer identifying red octagons or following hardcoded rules. Instead, it's relying on patterns learned from millions of driving examples. When it stops, it's not because it understands the sign, it's because it has seen enough similar scenarios to predict that stopping is likely what a human would do in that situation.</p> 
    
    <p>So while it might look like your Tesla is reading stop signs, it's really just guessing. And that's why, in a very real sense, your Tesla doesn't actually know what a stop sign is.</p>
